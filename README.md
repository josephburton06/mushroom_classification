### This repo is for a mushroom classification project used from a Kaggle dataset.  The dataset was very clean, so the main focus of the project was working on finding insights into what features may help determine whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous.

### In the visualizations_model Jupyter Notebook, we run logistic regression and a decision tree based on a few features, but one in particular that seems to be the key to dataset.  We do see great results on both test and train sets.

### In the model_second_iteration, we do the same process, but split the dataset into two dataframes.  We separate mushrooms with no odor from the rest and our predictions improve!

### Why is a project like this important to a company?  This same process can be used to help determine whether a customer may churn, whether or not an employee will churn, etc.
