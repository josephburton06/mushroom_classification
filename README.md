# This repo is for a mushroom classification project used from a Kaggle dataset.  The dataset was very clean, so the main focus of the project was working on finding insights into what features may help determine whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous.

# Why is a project like this important to a company?  This same process can be used to help determine whether a customer may churn, whether or not an employee will churn, etc.
